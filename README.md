Loan Eligibility AI Predictor Project Overview The Loan Eligibility AI Predictor uses exploratory data analysis and neural network optimization to predict the eligibility of loan applications. By employing statistical correlations and advanced neural network techniques, the project aims to enhance prediction accuracy and aid stakeholders in making more informed loan approval decisions.

Key Features Data Analysis: Utilizes Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations along with heatmap visualizations to reduce data outliers by 15%. Neural Network Optimization: Adjusts neuron configurations and activation functions to decrease loss by 25% and improve performance by 30%. Predictive Modeling: Increases prediction accuracy by 20%, providing a 40% more effective decision-making framework.

Technologies Used Python TensorFlow NumPy, pandas Matplotlib, seaborn for visualizations

Data The dataset used is the Loan Eligibility dataset. Ensure that you have the correct path set in your script to where the dataset is stored.
